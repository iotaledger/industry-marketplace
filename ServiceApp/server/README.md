#  Summary
The next generation of industrial automation, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is rapidly approaching. In
tomorrow's world, devices will contain not only asset information, but proactive decision and
optimization algorithms to enable goal-oriented behavior among their components. Such I4.0
devices can be viewed as autonomous independent economic agents that cooperate
according to market economy principles.

The highly flexible value creation networks that result from I4.0 will require new forms of
collaboration between companies - both at the national and global level. And the successful
implementation of I4.0 will depend on the creation of a common global communication and
computing infrastructure that allows economic relationships between machines.
By combining the latest technology with established standards and openly-developed
specifications, the Industry Marketplace will provide this platform and enable the economy of
things.

The Industry Marketplace will serve as a vendor and industry-neutral platform, automating
the trading of physical and digital goods / services. Building on specifications developed by
the Plattform Industrie 4.0 (Germany’s central network for the advancement of digital
transformation in manufacturing), the Industry Marketplace combines distributed ledger
technology, immutable audit logs, and standardized, machine-readable contracts with an
integrated decentralized identity system, to ensure the authenticity of all participants and
enable secure communication and payments across the industry landscape.
The Industry Marketplace has been developed as an open source initiative and is free to
join. A simple trial can be run at your office to explore its potential. We encourage open
innovation with other industry partners to explore new business models and the many
possibilities of industrial automation.
