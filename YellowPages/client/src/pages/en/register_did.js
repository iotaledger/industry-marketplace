                    <p>This is a prerequisite to form legal contracts and discard fake bids. Registering your component with the IOTA Foundation will add your instance to a whitelist.<br />Your instance will see all proposals and bids of all participants on the default setting. After your instance has been registered, you can change the setting to receive only activities from other registered participants. </p>
                    <p>Corporate environments will benefit most from this setting, as it heavily reduces fake bids.</p>
                    <p>This registration is available for enterprise-, academic, and public bodies, as well as reputable IOTA community members.</p>
